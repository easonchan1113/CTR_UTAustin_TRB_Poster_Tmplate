# CTR_UTAustin_TRB_Poster_Template
This is the template for preparing posters for the University of Texas at Austin - Center of Transportation Research. This is a latex template based on the official template available at http://ctr.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/SYMPoster2017.pptx. The template is based on the Aalborg University template created by Jesper Kj√¶r Nielsen and available at https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates.

The poster shown in the template is based on my paper titled "Developing Priority Index for Managing Utility Disruptions in Urban Areas with Focus on Cascading and Interdependent Effects", presented at the 97th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board held at Washington D. C. during January 7 - 11, 2018. The full paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0361198118774239.

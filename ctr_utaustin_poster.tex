\begin{posterbox}[name=intro,column=0,row=0]{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Urban infrastructure consists of multiple components and assumes a "networked structure."
  \item A single infrastructure failure could trigger multiple failures in dependent systems due to the interdependencies in the urban network, causing widespread disruptions in utility services.
  \item During such events, urban communities are susceptible to the direct impacts of the event, as well as to prolonged utility disruptions.
  \item A methodological framework to assess and prioritize communities who are most vulnerable to such utility disruptions arising from disasters does not exist.
\end{itemize}
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[name=usage,column=0,below=intro]{Methodology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The direct and indirect impacts of the event on the performance of various utility systems in the infrastructure network are quantified using agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. 
        \item The exposure of the initial event on the network depends on the structure of the infrastructure network, and the interdependent relationships existing among its various components.
        \item A sample of building footprint in the study area is obtained, and the utility service disruptions are mapped based on their geographic location.
        \item The social vulnerability characteristics of communities residing in the affected regions are evaluated using the generic social variables obtained from American Community Survey (ACS) data.
        \item The normalized exposure of communities to the utility disruptions is combined with the social vulnerability index to develop the priority index for immediate relief operations.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The methodology stresses upon the fact that utility disruptions happen not just due to direct impact of disasters, but also due to its cascading and interdependent effects.
    \item The framework could be employed for emergency planning, as well as for managing immediate relief operations, such as distribution of food, and water during disasters. 
    \item The redundancy of the infrastructure network and the ability of individual infrastructure nodes to negate the impacts of utility service failures through backup systems are not considered in the current study.
